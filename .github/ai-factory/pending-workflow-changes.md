# Pending Workflow Changes

This file tracks workflow YAML changes that have been designed by the AI Worker
but cannot be committed directly (D-029: the worker must not write to
`.github/workflows/`). Each entry includes the complete YAML and instructions
for the human owner to commit it.

## 1. File-overlap dispatch guard — `ai-worker.yml` implement job

**Issue**: #586  
**Parent**: #570 (prevent contract-regression cascades)  
**Status**: ⚠️ Pending human commit

### Where to add

In `.github/workflows/ai-worker.yml`, in the `implement` job:

1. Add the guard step **immediately after** the `Update labels — implementation started`
   step (after line ~422, before the `Implement sub-task` step that uses
   `anthropics/claude-code-action@v1`).

2. Add an `if:` condition to the **`Implement sub-task`** step so it skips when
   the guard deferred:

   ```yaml
         - name: Implement sub-task
           id: implement
           if: steps.guard.outputs.deferred != 'true'
   ```

   Without this `if:` condition the guard detects and labels the overlap but
   cannot stop the Claude Code action from running.

### What it does

Before the worker starts implementing a sub-task, this step checks whether any
other open sub-issue (carrying both `ai-in-progress` and `ai-task` labels)
touches the same files as the current sub-issue. If an overlap is found, the
worker defers instead of proceeding — it posts a comment, adds `ai-blocked` +
`ai-auto-retry`, and exits 0 so the watchdog can retry once the blocking issue
clears.

This prevents the conversations-cascade pattern (issues #536–#540) where
5 workers ran concurrently on issues that all shared `dashboard/lib/conversations.ts`.

**Failure mode**: fail-open. If the guard itself errors (API timeout, parse
failure, etc.), it logs a warning and allows the implement step to continue.

### YAML step to add

### Verification checklist

Before committing, verify:

- [ ] The guard step is placed after `Update labels — implementation started` and before `Implement sub-task`
- [ ] The guard step has `id: guard` so its outputs are referenceable
- [ ] The `Implement sub-task` step has `if: steps.guard.outputs.deferred != 'true'` (critical — without this the guard cannot stop the implementation)
- [ ] The indentation matches the surrounding steps (6 spaces for `- name:`)
- [ ] `${{ github.repository }}` and `$ISSUE_NUMBER` are used (same as surrounding steps)
- [ ] YAML is syntactically valid: `yamllint .github/workflows/ai-worker.yml`

### Logic paths

| Scenario | Outcome |
|----------|---------|
| Issue has no `## Files to change` section | Guard skipped, implementation proceeds |
| No other `ai-in-progress ai-task` issues | Guard passes, implementation proceeds |
| Other in-progress issues found, no file overlap | Guard passes, implementation proceeds |
| Overlap found with issue #N | Comment posted, `ai-blocked`+`ai-auto-retry` added, `deferred=true` output set, implement step skipped |
| Guard itself errors (API timeout, parse error) | Warning logged, implementation proceeds (fail-open) |

### Known limitations

**TOCTOU race (mutual deferral)**: The `ai-in-progress` label is added to the current
issue *before* the guard step runs (by the `Update labels — implementation started` step).
If a second worker dispatches for a different sub-issue in the narrow window between that
label addition and the guard query (~5 s), both workers may see each other as
`ai-in-progress` and mutually defer. The watchdog's `ai-auto-retry` loop will resolve
this automatically on the next retry cycle; it is not a permanent deadlock.

**Parent-scope fallback**: When no `Closes #N` reference is found in the issue body,
the guard falls back to a repo-wide search. This is broader than ideal but safe — the
file-overlap check is still the deciding factor.

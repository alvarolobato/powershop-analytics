# Proposal: Fix ai-etl-health.yml turn exhaustion (Issue #698)

**Status**: Pending human commit (D-029 constraint — AI worker cannot write under `.github/workflows/`)

**Owner action required**: Copy the YAML below into `.github/workflows/ai-etl-health.yml` and commit.

## Changes

- Removed `Load knowledge bundle` step and its `${{ steps.load-knowledge.outputs.bundle }}` prompt reference. The ETL health agent reads source files directly and does not need ~7K tokens of retail/wholesale business rules.
- Increased `--max-turns` from 15 to 25 to give the agent sufficient budget for 4 audit areas across multiple files.

## Proposed `.github/workflows/ai-etl-health.yml`

```yaml

            You are the ETL Health Monitor. Check the health of the data pipeline.

            ## Checks to perform
            1. **Review ETL code** for potential issues:
               - Read etl/main.py and etl/sync/*.py
               - Check for error handling gaps
               - Verify connection retry logic
               - Check that all sync modules are registered in main.py

            2. **Review schema consistency**:
               - Read etl/schema/init.sql
               - Verify all ps_* tables have proper indexes
               - Check that FK constraints reference valid tables

            3. **Review ETL sync strategy**:
               - Read docs/etl-sync-strategy.md
               - Check that documented delta fields match code implementations
               - Verify watermark logic is correct

            4. **Check Docker health**:
               - Read docker-compose.yml
               - Verify ETL service has proper health checks
               - Check environment variable references

            ## Output
            If issues found, create ONE issue with title prefix `[etl-health]`:
            - List all findings grouped by severity
            - Include file paths and line numbers
            - Suggest fixes

            If everything looks healthy, do NOT create an issue. Silence is golden.

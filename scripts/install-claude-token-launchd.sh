# Install the launchd agent that keeps ~/.claude/.credentials.json fresh from
# the macOS Keychain so the dashboard container can read it without any
# manual intervention. Idempotent: re-running replaces the agent with the
# current template.
#
# What it does:
#   1. Resolves the repo root (the directory two levels above this script).
#   2. Renders scripts/launchd/com.powershop.claude-token-sync.plist.template
#      into ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.powershop.claude-token-sync.plist
#      with __REPO_ROOT__ and __HOME__ substituted.
#   3. Bootstraps it via launchctl. Tries `launchctl bootstrap gui/<uid>` first
#      (modern API, macOS 10.10+) and falls back to `launchctl load` for older
#      systems.
#   4. Triggers a kickstart so the first run happens immediately, surfacing
#      any setup errors right away.
#
# Safety: this script never touches the Keychain itself. It only installs the
# plist and asks launchd to start it. The agent's job is sync-only — see the
# header of scripts/sync-claude-token.sh for the why.

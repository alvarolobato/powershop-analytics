# Sync the Claude OAuth payload from the macOS Keychain to
# ~/.claude/.credentials.json so the dashboard container can read it.
#
# This is THE refresher entrypoint, run on a schedule by the launchd agent
# (~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.powershop.claude-token-sync.plist). Despite the
# name, it does NOT attempt to refresh the OAuth token itself — that endpoint
# at claude.ai is protected by Cloudflare and direct curl POSTs return an
# anti-bot challenge page (issue #419, D-024). The host claude CLI handles
# token rotation internally during normal use; we only mirror its output.
#
# The dashboard container also never refreshes — see
# DECISIONS-AND-CHANGES.md D-025 and the Apr 2026 incident in
# memory/project_dashboard_claude_cli_auth.md (rotating refresh_tokens from
# the container invalidated the Keychain copy and forced the host user to
# `claude /login`).
#
# Behaviour:
#   1. Read the OAuth payload from the Keychain entry "Claude Code-credentials".
#   2. Validate it as JSON with a claudeAiOauth.expiresAt field.
#   3. Atomically write it to ~/.claude/.credentials.json (chmod 600). The
#      atomic rename means the container never sees a half-written file.
#   4. Print the remaining lifetime so launchd logs serve as a heads-up.
#
# When the access_token actually expires and host claude cannot refresh
# (Cloudflare-blocked), the user runs `claude /login` once. This script keeps
# the container in sync but does not try to be cleverer than the platform
# allows.
#
# Idempotent. Safe to run hundreds of times per day. Always exits 0 — failures
# are logged but don't fail the launchd cycle.

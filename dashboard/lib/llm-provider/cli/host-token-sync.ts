/**
 * On-demand trigger for the host's launchd `claude-token-sync` agent.
 *
 * Background — see DECISIONS-AND-CHANGES.md D-025 for the full context.
 * The macOS Keychain is the single source of truth for the Claude OAuth
 * payload, refreshed only by the host `claude` CLI during interactive use.
 * A launchd agent on the host mirrors the Keychain into
 * `~/.claude/.credentials.json` every 2 h so the dashboard container can
 * read it. **The container never refreshes the token.**
 *
 * Failure mode this module fixes: a host-side `claude` invocation (e.g. an
 * agent debugging from the same machine) rotates the Keychain refresh_token,
 * which revokes the access_token still cached in the container's mounted
 * credentials file. The next CLI spawn from the container fails with
 * `401 authentication_failed`. Without this helper, the user has to wait
 * up to 2 h for the next launchd cycle (or run the install script manually).
 *
 * On-demand path:
 *   1. The CLI runner detects a 401 / LLM_CLI_AUTH error.
 *   2. It calls `triggerHostTokenSync()`.
 *   3. We touch `/config/.claude-token-kick` (host-mounted rw at
 *      `~/.config/powershop-analytics/.claude-token-kick`).
 *   4. The host launchd agent's `WatchPaths` fires, runs the same
 *      sync-only script (no refresh — D-025 stands), and writes the
 *      current Keychain content into `~/.claude/.credentials.json`
 *      via temp+rename (atomic).
 *   5. We poll the credentials file's mtime; once it advances we know
 *      the file was rewritten and the runner can retry the spawn.
 *
 * This helper is deliberately a no-op when the host plumbing is missing
 * (kick path absent or unwritable, credentials file absent) — a single
 * 401 will then surface to the user as before, with the diagnostic hint
 * to run the install script.

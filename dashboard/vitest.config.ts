// Node 22+ ships an experimental global `localStorage`/`sessionStorage` (flag
// `--experimental-webstorage`, on by default). It installs a lazy accessor on
// `globalThis` that jsdom's own `window.localStorage` cannot override, so
// every jsdom-environment test (~50 files here use `@vitest-environment
// jsdom`) sees `localStorage === undefined` (with a noisy "--localstorage-file
// was not provided" warning) instead of jsdom's working in-memory Storage.
// Disabling the Node feature for the worker processes vitest forks restores
// jsdom's implementation. Set here (not in package.json's test script) so it
// applies uniformly regardless of how vitest is invoked (npm test, npx
// vitest, CI, watch mode).
//
// ONLY on Node >= 22. The flag does not exist before 22 (there is no
// webstorage feature to disable there), and Node REJECTS an unknown flag in
// NODE_OPTIONS — `node: --no-experimental-webstorage is not allowed in
// NODE_OPTIONS` — which kills every worker vitest forks. Gate on the running
// major so the fix applies exactly where the problem exists (package.json
// allows Node >=20.19.0, so both sides of this gate are reachable).

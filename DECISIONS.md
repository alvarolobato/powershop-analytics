# DECISIONS.md — Decision index

> **Purpose.** One-line binding rules so agents don't re-evaluate settled decisions. Full rationale, alternatives, and incident context live in `docs/decisions/D-NN-<slug>.md` — read those when you need the *why*.
>
> **Adding a new decision.** Write a one-liner here (binding rule, ≤180 chars) + a full file in `docs/decisions/`. See [AGENTS.md § Recording decisions](AGENTS.md#recording-decisions).
>
> Files in this index are kept terse on purpose. Don't expand entries — expand the per-decision file instead.

## AI Factory — policy and lifecycle

| ID | Binding rule |
|----|--------------|
| [D-011](docs/decisions/D-011-ai-factory-on-claude-code.md) | The AI Factory uses `anthropics/claude-code-action` (single LLM vendor); CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md are the agent's context. |
| [D-012](docs/decisions/D-012-no-reusable-workflows.md) | Build workflows in-repo. Don't extract to a reusable-action library until there's a second consumer. |
| [D-013](docs/decisions/D-013-humans-approve-merges.md) | Humans approve PR merges. No auto-merge for AI-generated PRs until trust is established per area. |
| [D-014](docs/decisions/D-014-label-driven-ai.md) | `ai-work` triggers the worker; `ai-blocked` pauses it; `no-ai` excludes the issue; priority labels (`p0`/`p1`/`p2`/`p3`) order work. |
| [D-021](docs/decisions/D-021-two-review-rounds.md) | Every PR gets exactly two review rounds, each once: Copilot, then Opus from a clean Claude Code context. No third round; escalate to owner if blocked. |
| [D-028](docs/decisions/D-028-weekly-business-review.md) | Weekly business-review issues carry `needs-human-approval` and never `ai-work` — the factory may triage and plan, never implement, until a human authorises. |
| [D-029](docs/decisions/D-029-no-worker-workflows.md) | The worker (and any claude-code-action job) must NOT write under `.github/workflows/`. Propose YAML in the PR body for a human commit. |
| [D-030](docs/decisions/D-030-watchdog-cadence.md) | Watchdog cron is `*/30` + `pull_request_review:[submitted]` + `pull_request:[closed]` to compensate for GitHub schedule queue saturation. |
| [D-031](docs/decisions/D-031-copilot-opus-sequencing.md) | `ai-pr-review.yml` fires only on `labeled:ai-ready-for-review`. Strict order: Copilot → address → Opus → address → owner-merge. No `\|\| true` on critical dispatches. |
| [D-033](docs/decisions/D-033-opus-review-marker.md) | Opus head-SHA idempotency requires `(.body \| length) > 0` (inline replies have empty body). Workflow runs matched by `display_title` via top-level `run-name`, never `head_sha` or `.inputs.*`. |
| [D-034](docs/decisions/D-034-single-track-issues.md) | Single-track issues by default (phases in body, one PR per phase). `ai-plan` for plan-only checkpoint; `ai-decompose` opts into sub-issues. Internal labels renamed `fact-*`. |

## Runtime / infrastructure

| ID | Binding rule |
|----|--------------|
| [D-002](docs/decisions/D-002-bind-mounts.md) | All container data lives in `./data/<svc>/` bind mounts. Never named volumes. |
| [D-005](docs/decisions/D-005-qdrant-no-recreate.md) | `recreate_index: false` in `wren-config.yaml`. Collections and embeddings must survive restarts. |
| [D-006](docs/decisions/D-006-openrouter-embeddings.md) | WrenAI embeddings use `openai/text-embedding-3-large` + `OPENAI_API_BASE=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`. The `openrouter/` prefix breaks embeddings under litellm. |
| [D-007](docs/decisions/D-007-wrenai-restart-loop-fix.md) | Don't set `SHOULD_FORCE_DEPLOY` on wren-ai-service. Deploy via `scripts/wren-push-metadata.py`. |
| [D-016](docs/decisions/D-016-etl-manual-trigger-table.md) | Dashboard signals manual ETL syncs via the PostgreSQL `etl_manual_trigger` table — never via an HTTP endpoint on the ETL container. |
| [D-020](docs/decisions/D-020-force-resync.md) | Force-resync writes `force_full` / `force_tables` to `etl_manual_trigger`; scheduler resets watermarks (from a single allow-list) before the run. |
| [D-023](docs/decisions/D-023-central-config-yaml.md) | All settings live in `~/.config/powershop-analytics/config.yaml`. Precedence: env var > config.yaml > default. Schema is `config/schema.yaml`. |
| [D-024](docs/decisions/D-024-surface-cli-errors.md) | CLI/agentic failures must surface a sanitized `diagnostic` (provider/driver/model/phase/duration/tool/CLI tail). All free-form strings pass through `dashboard/lib/llm-provider/sanitize.ts`. |
| [D-025](docs/decisions/D-025-oauth-single-refresher.md) | Only the host `claude` CLI ever refreshes the OAuth token. The launchd agent only mirrors the macOS Keychain into `~/.claude/.credentials.json`. Never POST to the OAuth endpoint from code. |

## Data / ETL

| ID | Binding rule |
|----|--------------|
| [D-001](docs/decisions/D-001-postgres-mirror.md) | Analytics queries hit a PostgreSQL mirror. Never touch the live 4D ERP from analytics paths. ETL is the only writer to the mirror. |
| [D-003](docs/decisions/D-003-single-select-no-offset.md) | For 4D tables < 2M rows, use a single SELECT — never LIMIT/OFFSET (4D re-scans from row 0 at each offset). |
| [D-004](docs/decisions/D-004-stock-sync-per-store.md) | Stock sync fetches one store at a time (`WHERE Tienda='X'`). 50 stores × ~80s. Don't fetch the full Exportaciones table. |
| [D-015](docs/decisions/D-015-schema-from-4dc.md) | Schema discovery uses string extraction on `PowerShop.4DC` + live `_USER_VIEWS` / `_USER_COLUMNS` queries. Don't rely on PowerShop install file trees alone. |
| [D-017](docs/decisions/D-017-signed-int16-stock.md) | Apply `decode_signed_int16_word()` ONLY to `Exportaciones.Stock1..Stock34` (and `CCStock.Stock1..Stock34`) — the type-3/length-2 columns. Never on Real (type-6) columns. |

## WrenAI knowledge

| ID | Binding rule |
|----|--------------|
| [D-008](docs/decisions/D-008-wrenai-knowledge-indexing.md) | After writing instructions/SQL-pairs to SQLite, POST them to wren-ai-service `/v1/instructions` and `/v1/sql-pairs` to index into qdrant. `deploy(force:true)` only indexes schema. |
| [D-009](docs/decisions/D-009-is-default-merge.md) | Source knowledge entries use `is_default=1`. The push script only deletes/rewrites `is_default=1`. User entries (`is_default=0`) are never touched. |

## Dashboard App

| ID | Binding rule |
|----|--------------|
| [D-010](docs/decisions/D-010-custom-dashboard-generator.md) | Dashboard App is custom Next.js + Tremor (LLM generates a dashboard JSON spec). Don't try to retrofit Metabase / Evidence / ToolJet. |
| [D-018](docs/decisions/D-018-agentic-tools.md) | `generate`/`modify`/`analyze` use a backend-controlled tool loop via OpenRouter `chat.completions`. Read-only SQL only. Tool catalog + limits in `dashboard/lib/llm-tools/runner.ts`. |
| [D-019](docs/decisions/D-019-pluggable-llm-providers.md) | Dashboard LLM provider is `openrouter` or `cli` (selected by `DASHBOARD_LLM_PROVIDER`). CLI path uses argv-array spawn + JSON tool-step protocol. CLI rows log $0 estimated cost. |
| [D-022](docs/decisions/D-022-dashboard-redesign.md) | Dashboard chrome is token-driven (CSS variables on `<html>` data-attrs). New widgets/components go through the redesign tokens, not Tremor defaults. |
| [D-026](docs/decisions/D-026-home-page-inicio.md) | `/inicio` is a read-only home — no chat, no save flow, no Analizar launcher. Filters are implicit via `CURRENT_DATE`/`DATE_TRUNC`. Not a user-pickable template. |
| [D-027](docs/decisions/D-027-inicio-redesign.md) | `/` (root) renders the new home; dashboard list moved to `/paneles`. Home is bespoke React, not `DashboardRenderer`-driven. |
| [D-032](docs/decisions/D-032-free-chat-tools.md) | Free-chat uses `FREE_CHAT_TOOLS` (10 inspection + `start_dashboard_generation` + `set_title` = 12). `set_title` is idempotent (`AND title IS NULL`). Full write tools in `FULL_DASHBOARD_TOOLS`. Handoff via `POST /api/conversations/:id/handoff-to-dashboard`. |
